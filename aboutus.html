            <h1>MISSION<br> AND <br>VISION</h1>
            <p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning
                 and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from
                  digital images, videos and other visual inputsâ€”and to make recommendations or take actions
                   when they see defects or issues.<br>
                   AI Vision Systems have revolutionized the industrial and manufacturing world. 
                   With AI, industrial processes are faster, more accurate, and more scalable.
                    Countless industries have utilized AI for some years now for applications such as
                     visual inspection, quality control, and monitoring.</p>
